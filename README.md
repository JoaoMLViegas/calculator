# **Calculator App**

A simple calculator application built with Python and tkinter for a graphical user interface.

## **Features**
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Exponent and root operations
- Clear and intuitive GUI with buttons for digits and operations
- (in development...) Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero)

## **Getting Started**
### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. The app uses tkinter, which comes bundled with Python on most platforms. To check, run: 
``` 
python -m tkinter
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
```
git clone https://github.com/JoaoMLViegas/calculator.git  
cd calculator
```
2. Run the app:  
```
python calculator.py
```

## **Usage**
This calculator only calculates results when = is pressed, so to use it you should:
- Click on the numeric buttons to input numbers.
- Click on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to insert operators.
- Press = to see the result.
- Pressing C clears the screen and ← functions as a backspace, deleting the last character on the screen.
- Pressing the a^b or √ buttons opens a smaller window allowing exponent and root operations respectively.
